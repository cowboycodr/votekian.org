    <Heading>WHY I'M NOT RUNNING</Heading>
    <p class="plan__paragraph">
        For a comprehensive explanation on why I am
        withdrawing from the STUCCO election, it would
        be wise to explain why I was running in the
        first place.
    </p>
    <p class="plan__paragraph">
        I ran for the sole purpose to see the demise
        and fall of Ellen Bowser as our current
        STUCCO president. This may sound harsh, however,
        her intentionally reporting me to the school
        and removing me from the election of the 8th
        grade school year, quite frankly, demands
        imperative action on removing her from
        the current school board.
    </p>
    <p class="plan__paragraph">
        On to the topic of whether I will run again.
        I have not thoroughly thought about a 
        reconciliation of my STUCCO political career
        sophomore year leading on into junior year.
        It honestly depends on whether or not my 
        opponent Ellen will be returning as well.
    </p>
    <p class="plan__paragraph">
        Obviously, the election will continue this year
        and years to come. Without Ellen as a potential 
        candidate, I have no purpose to run. So instead, 
        I will use this website to advocate for a friend
        and better candidate of choice <b>Caroline Martucci</b>.
        She has more qualifications than me, and Ellen 
        combined; and would change something worth voting
        for unlike me or the evil intentions of Ellen.
    </p>
    <p class="plan__paragraph">
        Thank you for your support, guidance, and consideration
        along the way. I now complete my official withdrawing
        of the 2023 STUCCO presidential election.
    </p>
    <p class="plan__paragraph">
        Final thoughts: I will do everything in my
        God-given mind to keep Ellen Bowser out of 
        STUCCO presidential position for years to come.
    </p>
